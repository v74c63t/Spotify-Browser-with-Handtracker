8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
Users are able to navigate through most of the browser easily with hand gestures as well as being allowed to use it normally with the original A3 functonalities and many gestures have similar functions on each page (two hands pointing moving forward in the track list, open hand opening a selected page or some sort of page, and so on). Right next to each handtracker, there is a list of gestures and their functionalities so users can easily refer to them while they are using the handtracker.
